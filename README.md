# 50-python-projects-challenge

A 6-month, high-intensity Python engineering challenge focused on building real-world software skills through 50+ hands-on projects, progressing from core fundamentals to production-ready systems.
This repository is not about tutorials or copy-paste code — it is about thinking like an engineer and shipping working software.

## 🛠 Rules of Engagement (DevDiscipline) 
- 📁 **Atomic Structure** – Each project has its own dedicated folder -
- 📝 **Mandatory Documentation** – Every project contains its own README.md
- 🔥 **GitHub Streak** – Daily commits as public proof of work -
- 🚫 **Zero AI Policy** – No LLMs for coding or debugging - ⏳ **180-Day Deadline** – Minimum 50 projects in 6 months -
- 🎯 **Daily-Life Usage** – Every project solves a real personal problem

## 🎯 Problem-Driven Development
Every project solves a real-life or practical problem.
